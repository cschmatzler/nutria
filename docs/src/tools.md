# Tools

This chapter outlines some big-picture decisions on tools that will be used to set up and configure our infrastructure and deploy workloads. These are fundamental decisions that are not easily changed, and a lot of time was invested into making the right choices.  
In addition to outlining the decisions made, each tool also requires unique setup that will be explained in each sub-chapter.

## Installation

If you're on macOS, this repository comes with a `Brewfile`. To install all the required tools to follow the book, simply run
