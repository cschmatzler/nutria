# Goals

This project has a few goals.

## Learning

Most of all, setting up and maintaining my own Kubernetes cluster is a learning experience. I have always been interested in servers, networking and automation, and have been running all kinds of different services ever since I was a teenager. In more recent years, I have found more interest in managing my infrastructure and workloads as declarative code, which has led me to using Packer, Terraform and Flux for this project.

## Writing

Another interest of mine is technical writing. Admittedly, I am not very proficient at it, but there's nothing better to improve than have a project - and you're reading it! It has always been my goal to have proper documentation for my projects, and this book presents a good reference for me, and also for other people who want to set up something similar.
