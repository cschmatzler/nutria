## Data autonomy

Nowadays, very few companies own a majority of the services we are using online - and it's getting worse. With news that Amazon is making a TV show out of Ring doorbell clips, as well as buying Roomba and owning thousands of cameras inside peoples' homes now, as well as other companies owning huge landscapes of services, securing our own data is now more paramount than ever. Digging into what is available, it becomes apparent rather quickly that there is a huge amount of open source software out there that can replace many of the services we use each day. Most do not compare one-to-one, and quite frankly some have significantly worse user experiences, some are also very surprising in what they can offer and outdo their paid counterparts.  

## Playground

Next to appreciating the autonomy of running my own services and having control over my data, setting up and maintaining my own Kubernetes cluster is a learning experience. I have always been interested in servers, networking and automation, and have been running all kinds of different services ever since I was a teenager. In more recent years, I have found more interest in managing my infrastructure and workloads as declarative code, which has led me to using Packer, Terraform and Flux for this project.

## Writing

Another interest of mine is technical writing. Admittedly, I am not very proficient at it, but there's nothing better to improve than have a project - and you're reading it! It has always been my goal to have proper documentation for my projects, and this book presents a good reference for me, and also for other people who want to set up something similar.
