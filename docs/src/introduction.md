# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Nutria.  
This is my personal playground for all of my personal server hosting and management. I decided to completely have this in the open, hoping that some people might find and learn from it.

This is a living document. Every time I make a change to my own cluster, I will update the documentation. If you use this as a reference for your own project, I recommend making a copy of its current state.
